                <h1> Clinical Pathology</h1>
                <span>Clinical pathologists look at blood, urine, and other body fluid samples under a microscope, or
                    with other diagnostic tools. They watch levels of certain chemicals or other substances in the body.
                    A diagnosis or decision to do further study is then made based on the test results.</span>
                <span>Clinical pathologists work in close collaboration with clinical scientists  medical technologists, hospital administrators, and referring
                    physicians to ensure the accuracy and optimal utilization of laboratory testing.</span>

                <h1> Clinical Trial</h1>
                <span>Clinical trials are prospective biomedical or behavioral research studies on human participants
                    designed to answer specific questions about biomedical or behavioral interventions, including new
                    treatments (such as novel vaccines, drugs, dietary choices, dietary supplements, and medical
                    devices) and known interventions that warrant further study and comparison. Clinical trials generate
                    data on dosage, safety and efficacy.

                <h1>Cytology</h1>
                <span>Cytology is the exam of a single cell type, as often found in fluid specimens. It's mainly used to
                    diagnose or screen for cancer. It's also used to screen for fetal abnormalities, for pap smears, to
                    diagnose infectious organisms, and in other screening and diagnostic areas.</span>
                <span>Cytopathology is commonly used to investigate diseases involving a wide range of body sites, often
                    to aid in the diagnosis of cancer but also in the diagnosis of some infectious diseases and other
                    inflammatory conditions.For example, a common application of cytopathology is the Pap smear, a
                    screening tool used to detect precancerous cervical lesions that may lead to cervical cancer.</span>

                <h1> Biochemistry</h1>
                <span>At its most basic, biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes occurring in living matter.
                    However, this simple definition encompasses an incredibly diverse field of research that touches
                    nearly all aspects of our lives.

                    One of the most pressing issues in our society, environmental degradation, is being addressed by
                    biochemists. A few examples of work currently being performed include improvements in the efficiency
                    of photosynthesis to increase crop yields, bioremediation of polluted soils, development of new
                    feed-stocks, chemistries for the production of biofuels, genetic mapping of ecosystems to monitor
                    biodiversity, and methodologies for boosting biological capture of carbon. These and other
                    biochemical technologies may play a crucial role in our efforts to find a sustainable means of
                    living.</span>

                <h1>Hematology</h1>
                <span>Hematology (always spelled haematology in British English) is the branch of medicine concerned
                    with the study of the cause, prognosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases related to
                    blood. It involves treating diseases that affect the production of blood and its components,
                    such as blood cells, hemoglobin, blood proteins, bone marrow, platelets, blood vessels, spleen, and
                    the mechanism of coagulation. Such diseases might include hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, blood
                    clots (thrombus), other bleeding disorders, and blood cancers such as leukemia, multiple myeloma,
                    and lymphoma.The laboratory analysis of blood is frequently performed by a medical technologist
                    or medical laboratory scientist.</span>

                <h1> Histopathology</h1>
                <span>Histopathology is an international journal intended to be of practical value to surgical and
                    diagnostic histopathologists, and to investigators of human disease who employ histopathological
                    methods. Our primary purpose is to publish advances in pathology, in particular those applicable to
                    clinical practice and contributing to the better understanding of human disease.
                    Histopathological examination of tissues starts with surgery, biopsy, or autopsy. The tissue is
                    removed from the body or plant, and then, often following expert dissection in the fresh state,
                    placed in a fixative which stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay.

                <h1>Hormones</h1>
                <span>A hormone (from the Greek participle ὁρμῶν, "setting in motion") is a class of signaling molecules
                    in multicellular organisms that are sent to distant organs by complex biological processes to
                    regulate physiology and behavior.[1] Hormones are required for the correct development of animals,
                    plants and fungi. Due to the broad definition of a hormone (as a signaling molecule that exerts its
                    effects far from its site of production), numerous kinds of molecules can be classified as hormones.
                    Among the substances that can be considered hormones, are eicosanoids (e.g. prostaglandins and
                    thromboxanes), steroids (e.g. oestrogen and brassinosteroid), amino acid derivatives (e.g.
                    epinephrine and auxin), protein or peptides (e.g. insulin and CLE peptides), and gases (e.g.
                    ethylene and nitric oxide).</span>
