        <span>
            Laboratory management in India is a super specialized area. The need of the hour is to make dedicated investments in terms of high-end technologies, skilled manpower, automated equipments and compliance with stringent accreditation guidelines, providing excellent customer service. Since a lab within a hospital is run as one of the many departments, it typically does not receive the necessary attention from hospital management. This results in high inventory and costs, pilferage, inadequate quality / service turn-around-time causing dissatisfaction among clinicians and patients. In order to overcome these challenges, hospitals today are increasingly outsourcing lab management to external referral laboratories. This relatively new phenomenon is called Hospital Laboratory Management (HLM).

            HLM allows hospitals to offer the best diagnostic care to their patients, while maintaining focus on providing their core healthcare services.
